Data Science process:
Undestanding the aim or end goal -- what you intend to achieve
Check for anomalies and correct the data -- missing values
Missing count numbers
Reshape your data


DATA PREP.
understanding and cleaning your data:-----
Check statistical Distribution of data:
Visually represent your data: using matplotlib
Check the columns and understand types and count value.
Data transformation using Pandas - filter and drop columns, rename (and reshape your data)
Set up a unique identifier - setting your index or replacing.
Cleaning our cases -- Regular expressions is used to change case of our data columns. (one way of cleaning data i.e. Character enconding)
Renaming more then one column --

correlations within the data:----
interprete through --- target variables(credit/loan status) and predictor variables(loan status & loan amount) varibles
(data analysis)
what variables to look at
check correlation of different variables to others...
visualization with pandas --- using a correlation visualization bitmap

DATA CLEANING
Get missing values. Percentage and how it will affectus.
TECHNIQUES -- MeanMode Imputation for both categorical data & numerical/continuous variables
Pairwise for Categorical Varibles using 0&1 - checking and evaluation of data or deleting data: or using zeros

create a method, it is easier.
